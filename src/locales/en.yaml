welcome: >
  👋 Hi! This bot helps to quickly add transactions in Firefly III.
  It also can manage some of Firefly's entities.
needToSet: 'To start working with the bot, you need to specify the following:'
setFireflyUrl: '  - *🔗 Firefly URL* - URL address of your Firefly III instance'
setFireflyAccessToken: '  - *🔑 Access Token* created in Firefly III web interface'
navigateToSettings: To proceed further head over to *🔧 Settings*.

help: >
  🤖 Please navigate to bot *🔧 Settings* section and set up some stuff for using the bot.   
      
  ❕ To add a transaction, send an amount. It can be a number, or a math expression,
  like `100-5*3`.
  Upon receiving amount, bot will ask additional questions for transaction parameters.
    
  You can also add transactions that do not require additional questions from the bot,
  by sending transaction description and an amount, like so
    
  `Cafe 35`
    
  In this case a new withdrawal transaction from the default asset account and 
  description `Cafe` with amount of `35` will be created.
    
  ✨ Going further you can set up different *Rules* in a corresponding section of
  Firefly III, in which case all your bot transactions will be created respecting those
  rules.

common:
  errorOccurred: An error occurred!
  noDefaultSourceAccountExist: |

      Type in the foreign amount i.e. the amount in the destination account currency.  
        
      💡 You can use the arithmetic signs for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to
      perform the appropriate operation on the source account amount of the transaction.  
        
      For example, `*15` would multiply the initial amount by 15 to get the foreign amount.

    badAmountTyped: 'An amount should be a number. Type in new amount please:'
    badDescriptionTyped: 'Description needs to be text. Type in new description please:'
    typeNewAmount: >
      Type in new amount.

      💡 You can use the arithmetic signs for addition, subtraction, multiplication and division to perform the appropriate operation on the current value of the transaction.

      For example, "+35" would add 35 to existing amount of transaction.
